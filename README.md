# Interpretability Of OthelloGPT

This repository contains all the experiments I did for my [bachelor thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LbRze5JJj0oJfXFDVP5zSrijAnqvtCK4/view?usp=sharing) "Investigation of OthelloGPT World Model Learning using Mechanistic Interpretability"

## Whats OthelloGPT
- OthelloGPT is a toy transformer language model trained to predict legal moves in the board game Othello
- I'ts used as a testbed in interpretability research
